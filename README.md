# Disclaimer
Mind your step, this is my first Wordpress plugin. Looking for help and guidance always!

# Installation
If you can read the code, then it should be pretty easy. You can also follow the above article by Shift8Web.

I will clean this up eventually.

1. GIT clone the plugin to your wp-content/plugins directory.
2. Activate plugin.
3. Create ACF fields.
4. Create Wordpress Pages
